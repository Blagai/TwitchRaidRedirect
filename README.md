# TwitchRaidRedirect

A tool to automatically move you back from a raided Twitch channel to the channel that started the raid.

# Requirements

Script should be used inside Violentmonkey https://violentmonkey.github.io/

# How to use

To start the tool write startTwitchRaidRedirect() in the browser console and to stop stopTwitchRaidRedirect(). 
Resets every time you refresh or reopen the browser tab. Might be a way to fix that but I don't care enough to program it.
